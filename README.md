## Getting Started

This guide explains how to set up and run the application on a bare-metal operating system (Linux, macOS, or Windows) without Docker.

### **1. Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine.

### **2. Create Your Environment File**

In the project's root directory, copy the example environment file. This file is where you will store your broker credentials.

```sh
# For Linux or macOS
cp .env.example .env

# For Windows
copy .env.example .env
```

Open the newly created `.env` file with a text editor and fill in your personal Angel One API credentials. **This step is mandatory.**

### **3. Run the Setup Script**

The setup script will create a Python virtual environment and install all the necessary dependencies.

-   **For Linux or macOS**:
    ```sh
    # Make the script executable first
    chmod +x setup.sh
    # Run the setup script
    ./setup.sh
    ```

-   **For Windows**:
    ```cmd
    # Run the setup batch script
    .\setup.bat
    ```

### **4. Run the Application**

Once the setup is complete, you can start the trading portal.

-   **For Linux or macOS**:
    ```sh
    ./run.sh
    ```

-   **For Windows**:
    ```cmd
    .\run.bat
    ```

The script will start the web server.

## How to Use

-   **Access the Dashboard**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.
